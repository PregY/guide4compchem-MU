# Coding

Coding skills are not mandatory here but highly recommended, computational chemists nowadays are expected to be able to code anyway.

So for your future study and career, learn to code!

and most of the time, just Python is more than enough.



### Practical stuff
- Code editors
    - Vim
    - Emacs
    - Notepad++
    - Visual Studio Code
    - PyCharm
- Bash
- Python (perhaps all you ever need)
    - Pip and conda
    - Numpy
    - Pandas
    - Matplotlib
    - Seaborn
    - Scikit-learn
    - SciPy
    - (advanced) PyTorch, TensorFlow, Jax
- Git and GitHub for source code control
    - You should be able to use Git and GitHub to manage your source code and collaborate with others for reproducible and clean research.
    - and able to find stuffs (a lot of cool program as well as programming tutorial in Github) and install a package from GitHub.
- (Advanced, going low-level) Cython (C/C++ in Python)
- (Advanced, going low-level) Julia

- You should be able to look for information and learn new things by yourself as you will encounter a lot of errors and mishaps along the way.
