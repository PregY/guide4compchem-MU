# Chemical design

Although, our group is mostly dealing with `low-level` stuffs like mechanistic study and electronic structure elucidation. While these are indeed relevance in establishing the group-work for the higher stuffs later, I believe being able to extract design rules and come up with more superior catalysts can make your work more impactful.




## Theory stuff


### Molecular Volcano Plot


Molecular volcano plots have emerged as powerful tools for the study of homogeneous catalysis. They provide a graphical representation of the relationship between catalytic properties (activity and selectivity) and a chosen descriptor, typically the relative energy of an intermediate in the reaction mechanism.


Typically, determining catalytic properties requires computation of the entire free energy profile, involving numerous intermediate and transition states, exhaustive and time-consuming task!


Molecular volcano plot is a step beyond the that. Instead of the free energy profile, you just need to determine one or two descriptors to determine the catalytic properties, simplifying the determination of catalytic performance, making it possible to conduct high-throughput screening of catalysts. Moreover, it offers a more comprehensive understanding of catalytic properties than just inspecting bunch of energy profiles.

I personally have also combined the molecular volcano plot with microkinetic modelling (MKM) to build ***MKM volcano plot***. A coolest and possibly the ultimate form of volcano plot. Read my paper XD („Å£Ôºæ‚ñøÔºæ)üí®.


### Genetic Optimization

You can optimize your chemical structure towards target properties with genetic algorithm.

### Machine Learning
