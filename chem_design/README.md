# Chemical design

Although, our group is mostly dealing with `low-level` stuffs like mechanistic study and electronic structure elucidation. While these are indeed relevance in establishing the group-work for the higher stuffs later, I believe being able to extract design rules and come up with more superior catalysts can make your work more impactful.




## Theory stuff

I suggest you read these review papers (ranked by importance (my own view)) to be inspired and to get a sense of what is going on in the field (although note my date of writing, the field is changing all the time).
-  [Automated in Silico Design of Homogeneous Catalysts](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.9b04952)
- [Toward in silico Catalyst Optimization](https://www.chimia.ch/chimia/article/view/6270)
- [Data-driven discovery of organic electronic materials enabled by hybrid top-down/bottom-up design](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/638a772292f084b6bd248b36)
- [Computational Discovery of Transition-metal Complexes: From High-throughput Screening to Machine Learning](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c00347)
