# Chemical design

While our group primarily focuses on "low-level" tasks like mechanistic studies and electronic structure elucidation, it's important to recognize that these foundational efforts lay the groundwork for more advanced research. However, the ability to extract design rules and develop superior catalysts can significantly enhance the impact of your work. By applying these insights, we can advance our understanding of catalysis and contribute to the development of more effective catalysts, ultimately making a more significant contribution to the field. 


## Theory stuff


### Molecular Volcano Plot


Molecular volcano plots üåã have emerged as powerful tools for the study of homogeneous catalysis. They provide a graphical representation of the relationship between catalytic properties (activity and selectivity) and a chosen descriptor, typically the relative energy of an intermediate in the reaction mechanism.


Typically, determining catalytic properties requires computation of the entire free energy profile, involving numerous intermediate and transition states, exhaustive and time-consuming task! üò´


Molecular volcano plot is a step beyond the that. Instead of the free energy profile, you just need to determine one or two descriptors to determine the catalytic properties, simplifying the determination of catalytic performance, making it possible to conduct high-throughput screening of catalysts. Moreover, it offers a more comprehensive understanding of catalytic properties than just inspecting bunch of energy profiles.

As mentioned above, the chosen descriptor is typically an energetic one, namely the relative energy of the intermediate in the reaction mechanism. However, extracting chemical insights from such descriptors can be challenging. To address this, you can potentially correlate non-energetic descriptors with their energetic counterparts, possibly using multivariate linear regression from which the chemical insight can be extracted üß™‚ú®. These **non-energetic descriptors** can be computed with tools like [morfeus](https://digital-chemistry-laboratory.github.io/morfeus/), [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/), or [kallistro](https://ehjc.gitbook.io/kallisto/). Check out my paper how it is done („Å£Ôºæ‚ñøÔºæ)üí®.

I personally have also combined the molecular volcano plot with microkinetic modelling (MKM) to build ***MKM volcano plot***. A coolest and possibly the ultimate form of volcano plot. Read my paper XD („Å£Ôºæ‚ñøÔºæ)üí®.


### Genetic Optimization

You can optimize your chemical structure towards target properties with genetic algorithm.
