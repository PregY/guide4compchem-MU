# Guide for automated quantum-chemical calculations 


Basically, work smart and hard at the same time.

Keep in mind, this is just how I do things. You may find your own way of doing things which might even be more efficient than mine.


I also assume you use Window10 or Window11 on your personal machine.

### What you need

1. WSL
2. Ubuntu 
3. Conda or Miniconda
4. Maybe code editor as well (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.)

These should open up the possibility of cool stuffs you can do with your computer. For example,

1. xTB, CREST
2. Goodvibes
3. Multiwfn on linux
4. etc.
