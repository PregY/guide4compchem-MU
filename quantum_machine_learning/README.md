## Quantum-chemical machine learning (QML)

If you find yourselves doing ML in this group or that you are just interested in ML topics that align with the boss's research, you may want to check this folder out. It is cool stuffs anyway.

To gain a comprehensive overview of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in alignment with Prof. Panida's research interests, I recommend reading this paper [MUST READ](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h) by Prof. Kjell at ETHZ.

## Some theory stuffs

1. Data science
    - statistics
    - data visualization
    - machine learning
    - deep learning

2. Chemoinformatics 
    - text representation of molecules: **SMILES**, SELFIES, InChI
    - molecular descriptors
    - molecular fingerprints
    - molecular similarity

3. Quantum machine learning
    - representing molecules 
        - properties for molecular representation: unique, invariant, computationally efficient, and differentiable
        - text-based: SMILES, SELFIES, InChI
        - molecular graph
        - molecular descriptors
        - molecular fingerprints
        - electronic-structure-based (using 3D information)
    - machine learning
    - deep learning
    

## Practical stuffs
1. Coding skills (refer to above)
2. Basis ML
    - Supervised learning/ Unsupervised learning/ Reinforcement learning
    - Regression/ Classification
    - Overfitting/ Underfitting
    - Feature engineering (feature selection, feature extraction): see [Molecular representation](#molrep) below
    - Data preprocessing (data cleaning, data normalization, data augmentation)
    - Data visualization (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP)
    - Algorithms
        - Linear regression
        - Logistic regression
        - Ensemble models: Random forest, XGBoost
        - Kernel methods: SVM, Gaussian process, Kernel ridge regression (KRR)
        - Neural network: MLP, CNN, RNN, LSTM, Transformer
        - Clustering: K-means, DBSCAN
        - Support vector machine
        - Dimensionality reduction: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP
    - Model evaluation: 
        - Cross-validation or Leave-one-out cross-validation
        - Metrics: R2, RMSE, MAE, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, etc.   
    - Hyperparameter tuning (model selection)

(P.S. Most of the time, if you ever get to do QML, you will find yourself using molecular representation as below with Ensemble models and KRR)

#### Molecular representation


Core idea is basically to translate raw chemical information into a vector of numbers that computer can understand and can then be used as input for machine learning models.

- molecular descriptor: (e.g., molecular weight, buried volume, Sterimol parameters, etc.)
- Structure-based: [**SMILES**](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html), SELFIES, one-hot encoding, [1D/2D fingerprints](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.finger.html)

</div>


- Electronic structure-based (in QML/DScribe): 
    - Coulomb matrix (CM)
    - Bag of Bonds (BoB)
    - Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP)
    - Spectrum of London and Axillrod-Teller-Muto potential (SLATM) and the local (atomic) version of which (aSLATM)\
    - FCHL

#### Visualization of chemical space

You can reduce the dimensionality of your molecular representations (above) to 2D or 3D for visualizing your chemical space using various algorithms. Some common methods include:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
- [Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
