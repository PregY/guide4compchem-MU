# Guide for newcomer and current members of Compchem@MU

Welcome to the Compchem@MU! You will be working under Prof. Panida for here on. Trust me, she is a kind-soul and you will not find yourself under a better supervisor üòä. 

You will also get a lot of opportunities to collaborate with others, inside and outside the university as she has a pretty good networking. Particularly, with the Japaneses, under the Sakura exchange program üå∏ and others. So if you adore JP stuffs like me ‚∏Ç‚∏Ç‚∏ú(‡¥∞·¥ó‡¥∞‡πë)‚∏ù‚∏É‚∏É, again, there is no better advisor than her.

***DISCLAIMER*** You don't need to be familiar with everything mentioned below. Proficiency in first-principle calculations, especially DFT, is sufficient for conducting research in our group. However, I highly recommend diving into advanced topics, especially coding skills to automate routine tasks. In today's age of digitalization and the increasing importance of big data and machine learning, you'll find these advanced skills becoming increasingly relevant to your work. Besides, it is just more elegant to work more efficiently by having automated workflow/pipeline in your projects. üíªüìàü§ñ


## How to use this guide

Essential stuffs are on the main page here.

For the advanced topics, you can find them in the respective folders.
- [`coding`](/coding/README.md): coding skills
- [`AQC`](/AQC/README.md): automated quantum-chemical calculations
- [`quantum_machine_learning`](/quantum_machine_learning/README.md): quantum-chemical machine learning
- [`chem_design`](/chem_design/README.md): chemical design

If you may still find coding irrelevance to your work, **at least check out the [`AQC`](/AQC/README.md) folder**. *It will save you a lot of time and effort in the long run.*

## General research topics 

### 1. Homogenous catalytic reactions:
- Mechanistic study of catalytic reactions: to reveal the free energy profile   
- Electronic structure elucidation: to rationalize the reactivity and selectivity
- Catalyst design and substrate scope
    - virtual screening over a library of catalysts or substrates

    - exploration of chemical compound space 

### 2. Photochemical and photophysical properties
Mostly collaboration with experimentalists to validate their experimental results and to provide a theoretical explanation.


## Typical Quantum-Chemical Calculations

**DFT calculation**
